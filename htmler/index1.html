	<h1 class="h1">Object Oriented Programming</h1>
	<h2 class="h2">Introduction to OOP</h2>
	<div class="parent1">
		<p class="child1">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software
			design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field
			that has unique attributes and behavior.</p>
		<p class="child2">OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required
			to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and
			actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile
			applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.</p>
		<p class="child3">The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to
			collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code
			reusability, scalability and efficiency.!</p>
		<p class="child4">The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and
			identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise known as data modeling.
		</p>
		<p class="child5">Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data
			it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a
			method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Features of OOP</h2>
	<div class="parent2">
		<p class="parent2kop">1. Emphasis is on data rather than procedures.</p>
		<p class="parent2kop">2. Programs are divided into objects.</p>
		<p class="parent2kop">3. Function and data are tied together in a single unit.</p>
		<p class="parent2kop">4. Data is made hidden to prevent from accidental alteration from other
			function or objects.</p>
		<p class="parent2kop">5. Data access is done through the visible functions so that
			communication between objects is possible.</p>
		<p class="parent2kop">6. Data structures are modeled as objects.</p>
		<p class="parent2kop">7. Follows Bottom up approach of program design methodology</p>
	</div>

	<h2 class="h2">Class</h2>
	<p class="child10">A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
		Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables
		and together these data members and member functions define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a
		Class.</p>
	<h2 class="h2">Objects</h2>
	<p class="child10">An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an
		instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object
		is created) memory is allocated.</p>
	<h2 class="h2">Encapsulation</h2>
	<p class="child10"> Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In
		Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that
		manipulate them.</p>
	<h2 class="h2">Abstraction</h2>
	<p class="child10">Abstraction is the process of hiding irrelevant information from the user. For Example, when we
		are driving the car, first we start the engine by inserting a key. We are not aware of the process that goes on
		in the background for starting the engine.</p>
