	<div class="parent1">
		<h2 class="h1">Introduction to OOP</h2>
		<div class="child1">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.</div>
		<div class="child2">OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.</div>
		<div class="child3">The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.!</div>
		<div class="child4">The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise known as data modeling.</div>
		<div class="child5">Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages</div>
	</div>
	<div class="parent2">
		<h2 class="h2">Features of OOP</h2>
		<div class="child1">1. Emphasis is on data rather than procedures.</div>
		<div class="child2">2. Programs are divided into objects.</div>
		<div class="child3">3. Function and data are tied together in a single unit.</div>
		<div class="child4">5. Data access is done through the visible functions so that communication between objects is possible.
		</div>
		<div class="child5">6. Data structures are modeled as objects.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="parent3">
		<h2 class="h2">Class</h2>

		<div class="child1">A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions. Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.</div>
		
	</div>
	<div class="parent4">
		<h2 class="h2">Object</h2>

		<div class="child1">An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.</div>
		
	</div>
	<div class="parent5">
		<h2 class="h2">Encapsulation</h2>
		<div class="child1">Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.</div>
		
	</div>
	<div class="parent6">
		<h2 class="h2">Inheritance</h2>
		<div class="child1">Inheritance is the process of creating a new class that inherits the properties of an existing class. The new class is called a derived class and the existing class is called a base class.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="parent7">
		<h2 class="h2">Polymorphism</h2>
		<div class="child1">Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Any object that can be referred to by a parent class reference can be referred to by a child class reference.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="parent8">
		<h2 class="h2">Abstraction</h2>
		<div class="child1">Abstraction is the process of reducing the complexity of a program by providing a simplified interface to the user. Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming.</div>
