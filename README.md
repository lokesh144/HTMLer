# 🧾 C++ HTML & CSS Parser & Renderer

This project is a **C++-based HTML and CSS parser and renderer**, developed as a course project. It parses a static HTML file and applies styles defined in a CSS file. The output is rendered in a graphical window using **SDL2** and **SDL_ttf** libraries, simulating a basic browser rendering engine.

---

## 📌 Features Implemented

This project supports parsing and rendering of the following:

### ✅ HTML Tags
- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- `<h1>`, `<h2>` (Headings)
- `<div>` (Blocks/Sections)
- `<p>` (Paragraphs)

### ✅ CSS Features
- `color`, `background-color`
- `margin`, `padding`
- `font-size`
- `hover` effects:
  - Text color change
  - Background color change

---

## 🎯 Project Capabilities

This parser and renderer can handle:

- Nested HTML structure
- Class-based CSS styling (e.g., `.child1`, `.parent1`, etc.)
- Inline layout simulation
- Hover effect simulation
- Simplified box model (margin + padding)
- Consistent color rendering using SDL

## 🛠 How to Run

### 🔁 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-html-css-renderer.git
cd cpp-html-css-renderer
```

### 💻 Open in Visual Studio

1. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
2. Set the project as startup.
3. **Configure Environment Variables** for SDL:
   - Add paths to `SDL2` and `SDL_ttf` headers and libraries in:
     - Project Properties > VC++ Directories
     - Project Properties > Linker > Additional Dependencies
4. Build and Run.

> Make sure the sample HTML (`index.html`) and CSS (`style.css`) files are in the correct directory.
